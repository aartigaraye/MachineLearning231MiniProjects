# Resampling

For this assignment, we will be working with **two** of our previously used data sets -- one for classification and one for regression. For the classification problem, our goal is (once again) to predict which passengers would survive the Titanic shipwreck. For the regression problem, our goal is (also once again) to predict abalone age.

Load the data from `data/titanic.csv` and `data/abalone.csv` into *R* and refresh your memory about the variables they contain using their attached codebooks.

Make sure to change `survived` and `pclass` to factors, as before, and make sure to generate the `age` variable as `rings` + 1.5!
