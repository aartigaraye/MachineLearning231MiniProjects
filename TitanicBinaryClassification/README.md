## Binary Classification

For this assignment, we will be working with part of a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) that was the subject of a machine learning competition and is often used for practicing ML models. The goal is classification; specifically, to predict which passengers would survive the [Titanic shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic).

Load the data from `data/titanic.csv` into *R* and familiarize yourself with the variables it contains using the codebook (`data/titanic_codebook.txt`).

Notice that `survived` and `pclass` should be changed to factors. When changing `survived` to a factor, you may want to reorder the factor so that *"Yes"* is the first level.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!
